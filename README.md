# DrivenData - Harmful Algal Bloom Detection

## Overview

The objective of [this competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/143/tick-tick-bloom/) is to predict if a satellite image of an inland body of water contains harmful levels of algae from a list of latitude and longitude coordinates. 

## Main Challenges

Data:

- Being unfamiliar with satellite imagery, I had difficulty navigating the APIs, then processing the following .tiff files
- Samples were spread across the US and had different distributions
